# User manual — PitWall (organization / race direction)

A guide for whoever **operates** PitWall: setting up the race, running it live, fixing laps and producing results.

---

## 1. Introduction
![img: 01-home.png]

**PitWall** is the timing and management system for slot racing. It detects each car crossing the finish line through the timing hardware, with two compatible options:

- **DS-300** — via **serial port**. You can combine **up to 6 DS-300 tracks** in a single race: each box times its own lanes and PitWall combines them. Each box uses **its own port** (one box = one port).
- **DS-300 aggregator** — when an **aggregator device** bundles **several DS-300 boxes (2 to 4) over a single COM port**. PitWall separates the boxes by their frame id and numbers lanes consecutively (box 1 → 1–8, box 2 → 9–16, and so on up to **32 lanes** with 4 boxes). A **single start signal** launches all boxes at once.
- **BART (Policar)** — via **Bluetooth**. It supports **up to the maximum number of lanes that BART allows** (currently **32**).

You can use any of these sources; for PitWall the flow of crossings is equivalent.

- From the **home screen** you reach **Races**, **Settings** and the rest of the modules.
- At the bottom right you always see the **link status** (green = connected; "Sin señal" / no signal = check the cable/port or the Bluetooth).

**The race list** shows all your races with their status (pending / active / finished) and the New race (“+ Nueva carrera”) button.

## 2. Scenarios, categories and catalogs (your library)

To avoid reconfiguring the same thing for every race, PitWall keeps **reusable templates** that you then pick when creating a race.

**Scenarios (saved tracks).** A **scenario** is a saved physical track: number of tracks and lanes (e.g. `8+8+8 = 24`), its **lane sequence** (rotation) and the **default minimum time**. Any race assigned to that scenario inherits everything automatically.

![img: op-escenarios.png]

When editing a scenario you define its name, the lane configuration, you drag the **rotation sequence** (with **DSC rests** if there are spare drivers), the **default minimum time** and, optionally, **minimum laps per category** (a different Pt for GT, Touring, Classics… on that same track).

![img: op-escenario-form.png]

**Categories.** Level/class groups (GT, Touring, Classics…) that serve to **override the minimum time (Pt) per category** in each scenario and to classify cars and drivers.

![img: op-categorias.png]

**Reusable catalogs (drivers, teams, cars).** Keep your **database** of participants and equipment to reuse it across races:
- **Drivers** — name and category; each driver can have their identification **QR**.
- **Teams** — name, color, country, car and members.
- **Cars** — make, model and category.

All of them can be **bulk-imported from CSV** (the CSV template (“Plantilla CSV”) and Import CSV (“Importar CSV”) buttons, with a preview of new entries vs. duplicates) and exported.

![img: op-catalogo-pilotos.png]

![img: op-qr-pilotos.png]

> With Export QR (“Exportar QR”) you print the QR cards for all drivers (for the scan-based driver change in endurance — see *Driver shift control*).

## 3. Creating a race
![img: 03-wizard-step1.png]

Press New race (“+ Nueva carrera”) and follow the wizard:

- **Type**:
  - *Sprint* → a **quick race**, of **drivers or teams**.
  - *Endurance* → an **endurance race** (by teams), which adds the **control of how much each driver of the team has run** (see *Driver shift control*).
- **Lanes and tracks**: total number of lanes and how they are split across boxes (e.g. 8+8+6 = 3 DS-300 boxes).
- **Minimum lap time (Pt)**: below this time, a crossing is considered a **ghost** (bounce/double read) and does not count.
- **Passes**: how many times the **entire lane sequence** is run. 2 passes = the full rotation is run twice (double the heats).
- **Repeat lane**: each lane is run this number of **consecutive heats** (same lane), adding up the laps — to compare each repetition.
- **Pole** (optional) and **driver rules** (championship only: min/max per driver, change lock at the end of a heat).

> **Passes** and **repeat lane** only change how the heats are generated; totals are summed per participant.

> Do you manage the championship with **PitWall Control**? You don't have to type the teams and rotation again: you can **import the whole event** from Control (see *Importing a batch from PitWall Control*).

## 4. Importing a batch from PitWall Control
![img: op-import-tanda.png]

If you organize the championship with **PitWall Control** (the season manager), you can set up the event there —teams, cups, lanes and rotation— and pass it to PitWall **without typing anything again**. PitWall **auto-creates the race** from what it receives.

Go into **Races → Import batch**. There are **two ways** to bring the event over:

- **JSON file** — in Control you press **Export batch (JSON)** and save the file; in PitWall you **upload** it on the import screen.
- **Over the network (WiFi/LAN)** — in Control you press **Send to PitWall**: Control **discovers** your PitWall on the local network (or you enter the **IP** by hand) and asks for a **pairing PIN**. That PIN is the one shown by PitWall's **Import batch** screen — type it into Control to authorize the send.

**What PitWall creates.** Each **heat** of the Control event becomes a **batch**, with each team placed in its **starting lane**. The **rests** (`D1`, `D2`…) are placed and rotated like in any rotation (see *Batches, participants and rotation*).

**With pole.** If the event has pole (the **This race has pole** switch in Control; when exporting to a file it asks you), Control **does not send the lane order**. On PitWall's import screen tick **This race has pole**: PitWall creates the race with the **pole session** (all teams) and the grid is decided **after running the pole** (see *Pole*).

> Right after importing you can **edit the race** to assign it your club's **scenario** (and inherit its lanes, sequence and minimum time) — see *Editing race, batches and heats*.

> **Requirement:** for the network send, PitWall and PitWall Control must be on the **same** LAN/WiFi network. The pairing PIN is shown in PitWall's **Import batch**. The other half of the bridge —**bringing the results** back to Control— is explained in the *PitWall Control manual*.

## 5. Batches, participants and rotation
![img: 34-tanda.png]

A **batch** groups the participants and their **lane rotation** per heat. When you add the **teams/drivers**, PitWall automatically generates all the **heats**.

**How rotation works.** Each participant keeps changing lanes from heat to heat following the configured sequence (e.g. `1, 3, 5, 6, 4, 2`). This way everyone goes through every lane and conditions are evened out.

- *Example (6 lanes, 6 drivers):* in heat 1 driver A runs lane 1; in heat 2, lane 3; in heat 3, lane 5… until completing the loop through all lanes.

**Rotation your way.** PitWall proposes a balanced rotation automatically, but **you can manage it however you like**: reorder the **lane sequence** by hand (by dragging) to decide exactly which lane each participant runs in each heat.

**Rests.** If there are **more participants than lanes**, the sequence includes gaps (`0` / `DSC`) that are **rests**: in that heat that participant does not run. PitWall spreads them out evenly, but **you can also place them wherever you want** within the rotation (drag them to the position you prefer).

**With passes / repeat lane:**
- *2 passes* → the whole sequence repeats: `1,3,5,6,4,2, 1,3,5,6,4,2`.
- *Repeat lane 2* → each lane, two consecutive heats: `1,1,3,3,5,5,6,6,4,4,2,2`.

## 6. Editing race, batches and heats

After creating a race you can tweak it:
- **Edit race** — change the **name** and, **as long as there are no laps recorded**, the **scenario**. You can **assign** a scenario to a race that didn't have one, **change** it for another or **remove** it. When you **assign** a scenario, the race inherits its **lanes**, its rotation **sequence** and its **minimum time** (and the minimum laps per **category**, if it has them), and PitWall **regenerates the pending batches** with that configuration; when you **remove** it, the race switches to **manual mode** keeping the configuration it had. If there are already laps, the scenario is **locked** (so as not to break the data).

![img: op-edit-carrera.png]

> Typical case: you **import a batch from PitWall Control** (which arrives in manual mode) and then **edit it to assign your club's scenario**, so it inherits your track's lanes, sequence and minimum time.

- **Edit batch** — change the **names** of the participants and, if the batch hasn't started yet, its composition. If it already has heats started, it enters **rename-only mode** (no participants added or removed, so as not to unbalance the rotation).

![img: op-edit-tanda.png]

- **Edit heat** — change **who runs in each lane** in a specific heat, without regenerating the whole batch (useful if a team doesn't show up or there's a last-minute change).

## 7. Pole (pre-race qualifying)
![img: 44-pole-setup.png]

The **pole** is a qualifying lap **before** the race to decide the starting order. It's optional; it's enabled when creating the race (**Pole**) and it's launched from the race page → Set up Pole Position (“Configurar Pole Position”).

- **Participants**: everyone entered appears. The **order of the list** is the order in which they'll go out to do their lap; hit 🎲 Random (“🎲 Aleatorio”) to shuffle it.
- **Pole lane**: **everyone** does their qualifying lap on the **same lane** (so it's comparable). Pick it with **−/+** or with 🎲 Random (“🎲 Aleatorio”).
- Press Start Pole (“Empezar Pole”): each participant enters in turn, does their lap and PitWall records their best time. In timing you can enable Skip 1st crossing (“Omitir 1er cruce”) (out-lap) so the launch lap isn't counted.

**Pole results.** When it finishes, Pole Results (“Resultados Pole”) appears with the **final classification** (from fastest to slowest, with the gap to the leader and the **fastest lap**). From here you can ✏️ Edit times (“✏️ Editar tiempos”) if there was an error, or continue with 🚦 Assign starting lanes (“🚦 Asignar carriles de salida”).

![img: 46-pole-results.png]

**Assigning lanes after the pole.** The pole doesn't distribute lanes automatically: it opens the Lane choice (“Elección de carril”) screen, where each participant **chooses** their lane **in classification order** — the **poleman** (the fastest) chooses first, then the 2nd, and so on. It's the classic "the fastest one picks lane".

![img: 47-pole-lanes.png]

- The Choosing now (“Eligiendo ahora”) banner indicates whose turn it is; on the left you see the **choosing order** (the classification) and on the right the **available lanes** (with their color).
- Each one presses the lane they want; that lane disappears from the available ones and the turn passes to the next.
- **If there are more participants than lanes**, 💤 Rest (“💤 Descanso”) gaps appear: whoever picks a rest **doesn't run heat 1** and **enters the rotation from heat 2**.
- When everyone has chosen, press 🏁 Create First Batch (“🏁 Crear Primera Tanda”): PitWall creates the batch and generates all the heats with that grid as the starting point (the choosing order defines the initial position in the lane rotation). From there, the race rotates the lanes heat to heat as always (see *Batches and rotation*).

> The pole doesn't score in the race: it only decides **who picks lane first** and, with that, the starting grid of the first heat.

## 8. PitWall Lap — PIN for the teams
![img: 43-lap-pins.png]

**PitWall Lap** is the mobile view for each **team/driver** to follow their own timing from the phone (their laps, called out by voice, and their position). So that they only enter *their* panel, a **PIN** is handed out per team.

- Go into PitWall Lap · PINs (“PitWall Lap · PINs”) of the race. You'll see the address teams open on the mobile (e.g. `http://<server-IP>:3000/lap/<id>`) and the **TEAM → PIN** table.
- Give each team **their PIN**. When they open the address and enter it, they go straight into their panel.
- New (“Nuevo”) regenerates a team's PIN (in case it was leaked or they want to change it).

> The phones must be on the **same network** as the computer acting as server. Use the computer's IP, not `localhost`, when they open it from the phone. If you want teams to follow the race **from outside the venue** (over the internet), see *Public tracking over the internet*.

## 9. Running the race live
![img: 20-live-timing.png]

From the race page:

1. **Arm the heat** (▶). It stays ready waiting for the **GO** from the box.
2. **GO**: when the start is given at the box, the **lights** appear and the timer starts. Each track has its own clock (C1/C2/C3).
3. During the heat you see per lane: **total laps**, **last**, **average**, **best**, and at the top the **fastest lap** banner.
4. **Pause / Resume / Stop** the heat when needed.
5. When it ends (flag or time out), the heat closes and the **next one** is prepared.
6. When all the heats of a batch are done, the **next batch** starts.

**Choosing the view.** With the View (“Vista”) button you change the layout depending on the lanes: *Horizontal rows* (few lanes), *Compact grid* (many) or *Cards with details* (with laps/exits/pit/Δ per card).

**Switching batch, repeating a heat and finishing.** From the live screen itself you have shortcuts without leaving the screen:
- **Next batch** — when a batch's heats are done, it moves straight to the next.
- **Repeat heat** — if a heat was called bad (false start, incident), you launch it again with the same participants and lanes.
- **Finish race** — closes the race (the "flag"): the classification is frozen and the summary is generated for results and for the mobiles (PitWall Lap).

> "Sin señal del DS-300" (no DS-300 signal) warning: while it's showing, laps are **not recorded**. Check the connection before giving the GO.

## 10. Driver shift control (championships)

In **team championship** races you can enforce rules for sharing the wheel among a team's drivers. They are defined when creating the race:
- **Minimum / maximum time per driver** — each driver must run at least X and at most Y.
- **Lock after a change** — a minimum time before changing driver again.
- **Maximum number of shifts per driver**.

**Driver changes** are recorded by scanning the **driver's QR** (or entering their code) when they come onto the track. From the live screen you open **Shift control**, which shows the **current driver per lane**, the **accumulated time** of each one (warning if they break a rule) and the **shift history**; if a change was recorded wrong, you can **correct the time** of the shift.

> **The scanner camera on phones and tablets (local HTTPS).** The QR scanner uses the camera, and the browser only allows it on **localhost** (the operator's computer) or over **HTTPS**. A phone or tablet reaching PitWall through the network IP (192.168.x.x) will find the camera blocked, with the message *"Camera needs HTTPS or localhost"*. To scan from those devices, enable **Settings → Local HTTPS (QR scanner camera)**: PitWall opens a separate secure port (**3443** by default) without changing anything about normal operation, and the server must be **restarted** once. Then open driver control through the link **`https://IP:3443/control/shifts`** (they are ready for you in that same Settings section).

> **The security warning and how to remove it.** The first time a device opens the `https://` link, the browser warns once (**"connection not private → continue"**); once you accept, the camera works. If you want that warning gone, **install the PitWall CA** on the device: Settings has **Download CA** and the **`/cert`** page with a step-by-step guide for **iPhone/iPad, Android and Windows**. Installing the CA once is enough even if the network IP changes: PitWall only re-issues the server certificate and the device keeps trusting it.

## 11. Lap by lap and corrections (add / remove laps)
![img: 30-correcciones.png]

From the race (the **lap correction** button in the live screen or in results) you enter the **lap by lap** of each heat. It serves to fix wrongly recorded readings.

- **Left**: the lanes of the heat; pick the team/driver to review.
- **Right**: their lap list — **LAP** (no.), **TIME**, **CLOCK** (race moment) and **Δ PREV.** (difference from the previous lap).
- **Actions per lap**:
  - **Transfer** (↔) — pass the lap to **another lane/team** (if the system assigned it wrong).
  - **Ghost** — mark the lap as invalid (doesn't count) without deleting it; it can be **restored**.
  - **Delete** (🗑) — remove a lap.
  - **Add manual lap** — if a crossing was missed, you add it by hand.

> Use it with judgment: corrections change totals, averages and classification of that heat.

> **Automatic ghost laps.** A lap below the **Pt** (minimum time) is marked as a **ghost** and the lane that produced it **never** counts it. PitWall no longer reassigns it by guessing: it **holds** it and only assigns it to the lane that **confirms** it missed a crossing (when that lane crosses with a lap of ~double its average). If nobody confirms it, it stays here as a **ghost** for you to review by hand.

## 12. Results and exports
![img: 10-results-comparativa.png]

When it finishes (or at any time) go into **Results**:

- **Comparison** (grid): per participant, each lane with **Fastest / Average / Consistency / Exits / Pit-stops**. In **passes/repeat-lane** races, each lane is broken down into its **occurrences** (1/2, 2/2) to compare.
- **Progression / Positions / Gap to leader / Gap (grid) / Advanced statistics**: different analysis views (explained in detail in the *Statistics manual*).
- **Exports**: **Excel**, **Points (xlsx/csv)**, **Control (csv)**, **Export for GitHub**, **PDF**.

**Public results.** There's an open page —**Results**, in the home menu— where anyone can consult (without touching anything or being able to edit) the results of the **finished** races. It's the one you share with drivers and public so they can look at the classification and statistics of the race.

![img: op-resultados-publicos.png]

## 13. Training
![img: 40-training.png]

Besides races, PitWall has a **Training** mode (from the home screen) to run without setting up a full competition. There are two modes:

- **Free training**: records **laps per lane without a team structure**. Ideal for open sessions where each person tries the car and track; there's no rotation or classification, just times per lane.
- **Competition**: teams or drivers assigned to lanes with **automatic rotation after each batch**, like a race but designed to practice the championship format.

Choose the mode, assign the lanes and press **Start**. Live timing works the same as in a race (box GO, laps, best/average per lane).

**Competition training sessions are saved.** When **each heat's flag drops**, PitWall saves one row per lane that ran, with its **participant**, its **laps**, its **best lap** and its **average**. Participants who are **resting** and lanes **with no crossings** leave no row. A **forced stop does not save** that heat: it's discarded and repeated in full.

From the competition training setup, the **See saved sessions** link opens the list of sessions (**date**, **no. of heats**, **participants**, **laps** and **best lap**), most recent first. Pressing a session shows its detail with two blocks:

- **Classification** for the session: the winner is whoever **adds up the most laps** across all their heats and, on a tie, whoever has the **best lap**. The **average** is that of **all** their laps, weighted per heat (a 40-lap heat carries the weight it should against a 3-lap one).
- **Heat by heat**: the breakdown of each heat, lane by lane.

Each session can be **deleted** from its detail. If you stop the session with **STOP** and it saved at least one heat, PitWall takes you straight to **its** results.

> **Free training** does not save results: it's an open session of times per lane.

## 14. Settings
![img: 04-settings.png]

- **Data source**: choose where crossings come from — **Simulation**, **DS-300** (one box per port, with its lane count), **DS-300 aggregator** (several boxes over a single COM port: set the **port**, **baud** —57600, 8N1— and **number of boxes** 2/3/4 → 16/24/32 lanes) or **BART** over Bluetooth (it connects over **direct BLE** by default; **TCP** stays in the list for the emulator or a BLE→TCP bridge). With the aggregator, lanes are numbered consecutively (box 1 → 1–8, box 2 → 9–16…) and a single start signal launches all boxes.
- **Port setup, kept simple**: for each DS-300 circuit (and the aggregator) you only see **Port** and **Baud rate** at a glance. Pick the **port** from the detected list; if yours isn't there, tap **"Type the path manually"** to enter it (e.g. `COM3` or `/dev/ttys003`). The **baud rate** is a dropdown with the usual speeds (9600–921600), with **"Type manually"** for an out-of-list value. The fine serial settings (**Data bits, Parity, Stop bits, Flow control**) are folded under **"Advanced port options"**: they default to **8N1** and rarely need touching.
- **Tracks**: define saved tracks (lane sequence, minimum time).
- **Public tracking over the internet**: publish the public views on the internet to follow the race from outside the venue (see the next section).
- **License** and language (ES/EN).

**Version history.** In the **footer of every page** you see PitWall's **version** number. Pressing it opens the **Version history** (`/changelog`), with what was **Added**, **Improved** and **Fixed** in each update. The version **goes up with every update**, so you always know which PitWall you have and what has changed.

## 15. Public tracking over the internet
![img: op-seguimiento-publico.png]

By default PitWall's views (the **live timing**, the **Results** and **PitWall Lap**) are only visible on the **local network**. With **Public tracking over the internet** each club can **publish them on the internet** so drivers and public can follow the race **from outside the venue**, without opening ports or setting up a VPN: PitWall brings up the club's **own Cloudflare tunnel**.

It's in **Settings → Public tracking over the internet**. There are **two modes**:

- **Quick.** PitWall generates a **temporary URL** (`*.trycloudflare.com`) on the fly: **no account or domain**. It's the option for a one-off afternoon; keep in mind the URL **changes on every start**.
- **Own Cloudflare.** You use the club's **tunnel token** and **your own domain**, so the **URL is fixed** and branded. The screen itself carries a **step-by-step guide**, with links to Cloudflare's **Zero Trust** dashboard and to the official documentation, to create the tunnel and paste its token.

**Controls.** **Start** / **Stop** buttons with the **status** and the **live URL** (to copy and share it). **Start** applies whatever you have on screen at that moment. You can enable **auto-start** so the tunnel comes up by itself when PitWall opens.

**Install cloudflared.** The tunnel is brought up by the `cloudflared` tool. If it isn't installed, the **Install cloudflared** button appears, which **downloads the official version** to PitWall's data folder — **without asking for administrator permissions**.

> **Security.** From outside, **only the public views are visible** (live timing, results and PitWall Lap). The **app control** (creating, running or editing races) is **blocked**: no one from outside can touch the race.
